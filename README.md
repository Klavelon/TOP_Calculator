# TOP_Calculator
Calculator Project from TheOdinProject Curriculum!

The main objective of this small project is to create a WebPage with an easy to use calculator interface that can support the following operations:

1: Addition.  
2: Subtraction.  
3: Multiplication.  
4: Division.  

It supports both Mouse and Keyboard inputs.

Creator Learning Notes:  

In this beginner project, I realised the value of creating smaller functions to do individual tasks, making my functions very read-able and allowing me to dynamically call them within event handlers to execute their specific tasks around my website.  

A large challenge I overcame was a solution to only allow accepted key inputs, so I created an Array of key maps that I would allow to be passed into primary function calls.  

This was the first time I opted to use a grid layout to position and scale my HTML elements on my page, and also including the use of some basic CSS animations to give a responsive feel to interactivity.
